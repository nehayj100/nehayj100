## Hi there 👋 I am Neha Joshi!

I am currently a second year MS Computer Engineering student at Texas A&M University specializing in Data Science and ML. 
I am graduating in May 2025.
Currently, I am working on some really interesting projects with Large Language models and Deep Learning.

I am looking for Full Time Opportunities starting from May 2025 as Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer.

I did my under-grad from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology receiving a convocation gold medal in 2020.
Post this, I wored for 3 years as a Data Scientist at AspectRatio with Merck US.
